Attrition Prediction with Neural Networks
Step 1: Preprocess the Data
First, import the necessary libraries, then load the employee attrition dataset. The data includes various features like age, department, and work-life balance, which are critical for predicting attrition. To prepare the data, we encode categorical variables and scale numerical ones, ensuring they are ready for the neural network to process.

Step 2: Define Features and Target Variables
Next, split the data into features (X) and target variables (Y). For this task, the target variables are the department and whether the employee will leave (attrition). The rest of the dataset forms the feature set.

Step 3: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
Use train_test_split to divide the features and target variables into training and testing datasets. Make sure to set a random state for reproducibility.

Step 4: Scale the Features
Use StandardScaler from scikit-learn to standardize the feature data. Fit the scaler to the training data, then transform both the training and testing sets. This step ensures that the neural network can process the features efficiently.

Build and Evaluate the Neural Network
Step 1: Create the Neural Network Model
Define a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model includes multiple layers, with ReLU activation functions for the hidden layers and appropriate output activations: sigmoid for binary classification (attrition) and softmax for multi-class classification (department).

Step 2: Compile and Fit the Model
Compile the model using the Adam optimizer and appropriate loss functions (binary_crossentropy for attrition and categorical_crossentropy for department). Then, fit the model to the training data, running it for several epochs to optimize performance.

Step 3: Evaluate Model Performance
After training, evaluate the model on the test data to calculate accuracy for both attrition and department predictions. Accuracy metrics give a quick overview of how well the model performs.

Answering Key Questions
1. Is accuracy the best metric to use on this data?

Accuracy might not be the best metric, especially for the attrition data, which could be imbalanced. In such cases, metrics like Precision, Recall, or F1-Score might give a better understanding of the modelâ€™s performance.

2. What activation functions did you choose for your output layers, and why?

For attrition, we used a sigmoid activation function due to its suitability for binary classification. For department prediction, a softmax function was used, which is ideal for multi-class classification tasks.

3. How might this model be improved?

Potential improvements include:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experimenting with different learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or selecting the most relevant ones could enhance model performance.
Data Balancing: Addressing any class imbalances in the dataset, potentially through techniques like SMOTE.
